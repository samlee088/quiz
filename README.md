## Usage

The quiz will initiate with the ‘start’ button located in the introduction. The quiz will end once either the user answers all of the available questions, or once the timer reaches 0. Once the user reaches the end of the quiz, they will be required to input text to submit in a score. The scores are stored locally, however there is a ‘reset’ action button to restore the list to a blank list.
